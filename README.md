# Simple 3D
Simple3D is a lightweight, three dimensional, graphics engine, I've developed (using only Java Standard Libraries), combined with some code I used to procedurally generate varying scenery for it to render. The user is free to move the camera along all three (extrinsic) axis, and is permitted to alter the camera's pitch yaw and roll (relative to the extrinsic axis set of the camera itself).

Below are some renders generated using this engine to show it's flexibility.

In the middle we show the texture mapping capability which will work for lower polygon counts. On the left is an image of a procedurally generated landscape (using 2D fractal perlin noise as a height map of sorts), and the final image is a maze that has been generated, then rendered in perspective from below.
