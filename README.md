# Simple 3D
Simple 3D is a lightweight three dimensional image combined with some code I used to procedurally generate varying scenery for it to render. The user is free to move the camera along all three (extrinsic) axis, and is permitted to alter the camera's pitch yaw and roll (relative to the extrinsic axis set of the camera itself).

Below are some renders generated using this engine to show it's flexibility.

On the far left we show the texture mapping capability which will work for lower polygon counts. The middle image is an image of a procedurally generated landscape (using 2D fractal perlin noise as a height map of sorts), and the final image is a maze that's been rendered at an arbitrary skewed angle.
